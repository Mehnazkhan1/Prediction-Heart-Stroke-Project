# My Data Set
### My datset is about predicting heart stroke. It has 12 columns and 5111 rows. It has different medical conditions which can relate to heart stroke.
### I wil be exploring if there is any main reason of heart stroke. I also check the correlation between them.
#### Source of data: https://www.kaggle.com/code/joshuaswords/predicting-a-stroke-shap-lime-explainer-eli5/data"
#### My hypothesis is that people who smoke more are more prone to have heart stroke.
